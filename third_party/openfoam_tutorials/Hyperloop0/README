Hyperloop Drag Simulation (No Compressor) in OpenFOAM

All code can be found at: https://github.com/lordvon/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/Hyperloop0

DESCRIPTION:
Here we will perform a simple 2D axisymmetric simulation of a transonic Hyperloop vehicle. Notice that the real Hyperloop (as described in the technical paper available on the SpaceX website) has a compressor at the front of the vehicle to power the air skis and reduce drag. This is not captured here, but could be modeled by a pressure jump actuator disk.

OUTLINE:
-Create wedge mesh in Gmsh.
-Convert the mesh and change the boundary file.
-Change the write format in system/controlDict to 'binary' to prevent errors.
-Run the simulation and view post-processed results.

COMMANDS:
gmsh mesh/main.geo -3 -o test.msh
gmshToFoam test.msh -case case
# Modify boundary file
rhoCentralFoam
