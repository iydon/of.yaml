Making Meshes for OpenFOAM with Gmsh, Part 0: Basic Scripting and Structured Mesh

DESCRIPTION:
Here we will make a 2D square mesh and learn the basics of Gmsh scripting.

There are many meshing utilities out there, but Gmsh is my favorite because you can make the mesh with the Gmsh scripting language, which is similar to C. Making a mesh this way, you can make quick changes to the geometry and mesh density by changing user-defined variables. This goes along well with what I think CFD is useful for: exploration of design spaces by variation of parameters.
