# Space Capsule Atmospheric Entry Simulation in OpenFOAM

All code can be found at:
https://github.com/rlee32/openfoam_tutorials/tree/master/SpaceCapsule

## Description
Here we simulate supersonic reentry of a generically-shaped space capsule.
We will use an axisymmetric configuration. Some specifics of the sonicFoam
solver will be discussed and bow shocks in the solution will be observed.

## Outline
-Create mesh in Gmsh.
-Convert the mesh and change the boundary file.
-Run the simulation and view post-processed results.

## Commands
gmsh mesh.geo -3 -o test.msh
gmshToFoam test.msh -case case
(Modify boundary file)
  -vehicle as wall
  -wedge0 and wedge1 as wedge
  -tunnel as slip
sonicFoam

## Software
-Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
-OpenFOAM 3.0.0
-Gmsh 2.11
