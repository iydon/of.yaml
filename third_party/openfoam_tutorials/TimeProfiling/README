Compiling Your Own Custom OpenFOAM Solver: Time Profiling

All code can be found at: https://github.com/lordvon/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/TimeProfiling

DESCRIPTION:
In this tutorial we profile the run time of an OpenFOAM solver by determining the run times of the different subcomponents. Specifically, we modify the pimpleDyMFoam solver (any solver can be modified in the same way as demonstrated here) and profile the standard 'propeller' tutorial case.

OUTLINE:
-Overview of the pimpleDyMFoam solver code.
-Description of the time-keeping method and modifications to the original solver.
-Compilation of the modified, time-profiling solver.
-View the results of running the new solver.
