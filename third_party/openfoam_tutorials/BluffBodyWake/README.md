# Simulation of a 2D Bluff Body in a High-Speed Wake in OpenFOAM

All code can be found at:
https://github.com/rlee32/openfoam_tutorials/tree/master/BluffBodyWake

## Description
In this tutorial we set a bluff body (high drag, no/low lift) into the
high-speed wake of an actuator disk. We shall see that this causes the bluff
body to become a more aerodynamic body. The high-speed wake reduces the drag of
this particular configuration by about a factor of 1.8 and the lift by about
1.7 (the L/D ratio is about 0.5 in both cases). The high-speed wake also
substantially mitigates large aerodynamic force oscillations.

## Outline
-Generate mesh in Gmsh.
-Convert mesh to OpenFOAM format.
-Make internal baffle faces a pressure jump region.
-Run the simulation.

## Commands
gmsh mesh.geo -3 -o test.msh

(Modify boundary file)
  -tunnel and body as walls
  -front_and_back as empty
  -baffle as cyclic
  -add baffleother and neighbourPatch entries
