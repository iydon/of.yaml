# MPI Parallel Simulations in OpenFOAM

All code can be found at:
https://github.com/rlee32/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/Parallel

## Description
In this tutorial we parallelize a tutorial case. We use the built-in
OpenFOAM MPI implementation and invoke a few built-in tools to help with setup
and post-processing.

## Outline
-Make and convert mesh.
-Go over decomposeParDict file.
-Decompose domain.
-Run simulation in parallel.
-Reconstruct output for viewing.

## Commands
gmsh mesh/mesh.geo -3 -o test.msh
gmshToFoam test.msh -case case
Modify boundary file:
  -frontAndBack as empty
  -wing as wall
  -tunnel as wall
decomposePar
mpirun -np 4 simpleFoam -parallel
reconstructPar -latestTime
