This folder contains a sub-utility that converts raw airfoil point data
that you might find online into a Gmsh-palatable form.

dat2geo.py: converts your raw airfoil point data into a geo file to be included
in the main.geo script. You have to change the variable in main.geo to point
to the desired airfoil geo file.

main.geo: generates the geometry from your specified airfoil geo file.
