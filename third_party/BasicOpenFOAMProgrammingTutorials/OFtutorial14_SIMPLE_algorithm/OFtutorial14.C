    Description
        This tutorial is about explaining how the SIMPLE algorithm is implemented
        through coding in OpenFOAM solvers like "simpleFoam". This tutorial is
        developed on OpenFOAM v2006 version and likely to work on v19 and above
        versions

        SIMPLE algorithm stands for "Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked
        Equations". it is one of the algorithms used in solving incompressible
        Navier-Stokes equations.

// Incompressible flows are governed by 4 PDEs, 3 momentum equations and 1
// continuity equation. The field variables involved in computation are also
// 4, Ux, Uy, Uz and P. So we have 4 equations and 4 unknowns, but we dont have
// an explicit equation for pressure P, hence the continuity equation is
// modified to involve pressure and thus solved as a pressure correction
// equation.
