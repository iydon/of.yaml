<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository was originally designed to solve the problem of complex OpenFOAM case structure, and the solution was to re-present the original cases using the common configuration file format YAML. Later, since there is a corresponding package for the YAML format in Python, I wrote this Python interface package for OpenFOAM, and then I added progress bars to most OpenFOAM solvers by analyzing log files in real time. Although there are still many details to be specified in this repository, its function of generating cases and calling solvers is ready for preliminary use, for example, I used this package to generate cases in batch in my own project. In the future I would like to integrate the post-processing steps into this interface package as well.
