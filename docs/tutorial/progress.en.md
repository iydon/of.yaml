## Tutorials

The repository [iydon/of.yaml-tutorial](https://github.com/iydon/of.yaml-tutorial) stores the official OpenFOAM tutorials that have been converted to YAML format. You can find the corresponding rules by comparing the YAML format with its original format, and I don't have the time or interest to organize the corresponding documentation for the time being.
